Unlocking New Skills with Digital Skill Fair 35.0! ðŸŒ¼

I recently had the opportunity to join the Digital Skill Fair 35.0 Bootcamp in Data Science by Dibimbing.id. This bootcamp provided an incredible learning experience, guided by expert mentors, and allowed me to apply data science techniques to real-world problems.

As a 6th-semester Chemistry student, I found Data Science to be an exciting and valuable field to explore. For my final project, I worked on a Wine Recognition classification using three different algorithms: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Through this project, I discovered that Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy among the three models.

Curious to see how the classification works? Check out my results below!

A huge thanks to dibimbing.id   for creating a platform that enables students from diverse backgrounds to learn and grow in Data Science!
